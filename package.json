So you can:\r - create your own .env with your own database info, just gotta be careful about constant process.env.CONSTANT names, and the line\r ```\r const Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema, 'tasks')\r ```\r in /models/Tasks.js will need to be replaced by\r ```\r const Task = mongoose.model('param1', param2, 'param3')\r ```\r where\r - param1 = the singular name of the collection your model is for\r - param2 = the schema, also defined in /models/Tasks.js\r - param3= SAME NAME that MongoDB is using for collection",
