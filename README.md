## Running the app
Right now you can use it online here: https://to-do-app-becvort.herokuapp.com/
Anyways, if you really need to run it on your localmachine, you'll need a .env document, that is not here uploaded for security reasons (user and password of the database). So you can:
- create your own .env with your own database info, just gotta be careful about constant process.env.CONSTANT names, and the line
```
const Task = mongoose.model('Task', taskSchema, 'tasks')
```
in /models/Tasks.js will need to be replaced by
```
const Task = mongoose.model('param1', param2, 'param3')
```
where
- param1 = the singular name of the collection your model is for
- param2 = the schema, also defined in /models/Tasks.js
- param3= SAME NAME that MongoDB is using for collection

once here, open a command prompt at the root proyect folder and run
```
npm run dev
```
wait till the message "Connected to database!" pop up

if you are not feeling like creating this .env file and change /models/Tasks.js, feel free to contact me at my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franco-becvort/) or [gmail](mailto:franbecvort@gmail.com), and I'll help you no problem, making the changes, or lending you the .env of myself (at the end, this is a begginer app, but you know, security is a big deal)
